# Code or Die

A Google Chrome extension to view the activity of your friends on LeetCode. (FireFox coming soon)

Code or Die is a Chrome extension that allows you to view your friends LeetCode activity and have friendly competitions through leaderboards that track your problems solved.

Just search up your friends' usernames, add them, and follow your feed for new updates on problems your friends have been solving. Get ideas for new problems to solve, compete on the leaderboard, or keep your friends accountable

## How it was built

Code or Die was my first attempt at creating a chrome extension and proved to be quite easy with prior web dev experience. Built in HTML/CSS/JS.

As for data population, LeetCode doesn't support their own official API. So I ended up using dev tools to inspect the Network requests on the LeetCode website to find their GraphQL endpoints.

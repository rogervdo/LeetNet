# Code or Die

Extension to view the activity of your friends on LeetCode.

Code or Die is an extension that allows you to view your friends LeetCode activity and have friendly competitions through leaderboards that track your problems solved.

Just search up your friends' usernames, add them, and follow your feed for new updates on problems your friends have been solving. Get ideas for new problems to solve, compete on the leaderboard, or keep your friends accountable.

See how many strikes (days in a row) your friends have without doing leetcodes
